Mexican Localization to Vendor Bills
====================================

This module allow:

- Attach fiscal documents on supplier invoices.
- Create new supplier invoice based on a CFDI.
- Create new supplier refund based on a CFDI.

To allow this process are made some validations as:

- The amount in the CFDI is the same that the invoice total (when only attach)
- The products are searched in the supplier info as first choise. If the product was bought from the
  supplier whose CFDI is being loaded, that info might be already loaded
  in the system.
- That the CFDI is not cancelled on the SAT system.
- The UUID is not attached in other documents
- The Folio in the CFDI is the same that in the vendor reference in the invoice.
- That the CFDI has the attribute TipoDeComprobante = I or TipoDeComprobante = E.
- For supplier refund, it must create a supplier invoice previously.

Only support CFDI on version 3.3
